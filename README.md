# GA4 Advanced tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

GA4 Advanced provides an open-source alternative to GA4 Base Tag 
There are a few key features provided by the current tag:
- Ability to override all parameters (including `_gcs` and `cid`)
- Data Source settings - you can build a request to Google Analytics using `eventData` properties (Beta)
- Compatible with Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol

## How to use the GA4 Advanced tag:

1. Create an GA4 Advanced tag and add GA4 triggers.
2. All fields are optional.

**Measurement ID** - If the event came from a GA4 web tag, you can leave this field blank to inherit the `Measurement ID` of the event

**Redact visitor IP address** - Remove visitor IP address from the event. Reports based on the event will not include geographic information.

**Event Name** - The event name to be sent to Google Analytics. If this field is blank, the value of the `event_name` parameter will be sent.

**Event Parameters** - Specify which parameters you want to include by default, add overwrites or remove existing.

**User Properties** - Specify which user properties you want to include by default, add overwrites or remove existing.

**Data Source Settings** - By default, incoming requests will be used as a data source for requests to Google Analytics. You can also choose `Event Data (Beta)` - in this case, all request properties will be constructed from the `eventData`. We have a list of parameters copied from [thyngster.com](https://www.thyngster.com/ga4-measurement-protocol-cheatsheet/) (Thanks a lot for your work ❤️), but for now, we don't have a mapping for all of these parameters, so you are welcome to open PR with improvements and fixes.  

**Logs Settings** - Specify whether the tag should write to the logs.
